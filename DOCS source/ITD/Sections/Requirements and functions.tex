\section{Implemented Functions}
With respect to the RASD and DD documents, we decided to implement the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Educator implemented functions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item createTournament();
            \item viewTournaments();
            \item viewTournament();
            \item createBattle();
            \item viewBattle();
            \item closeTournament();
            \item addCollaborator();
            \item manualEval();
            \item viewLeaderboard();
        \end{itemize}
    \item Student implemented functions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item viewTournaments();
            \item viewTournament();
            \item viewBattle();
            \item joinBattle();
            \item subscribeToTournament();
            \item viewLeaderboard();
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Implemented Modules}
We decided to implement the following modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web Server
    \item API Gateway
    \item Message Broker
    \item User Service
    \item Leaderboard Service
    \item Tournament Service
    \item Battle Service
    \item ManualEval Service
    \item Notification Service(It isn't connected to any email service but outputs what it would've sent in an email)
    \item Application and Source DBMS
\end{itemize}
The GitHub handler and software evaluation modules haven't been implemented since they are not required for showing the basic functionalities of the system.
Next follows a table representing which requirements have been satisfied.
