Since the Web Application wasn't working as expected we decided to instead run the various tests the group made through Postman. This way we would at least ensure the functionalities worked in the backend. The main problem was that the tests were written using particular tokens given at runtime on their machines. Our machines reported different tokens so no tests aside from the login and registering were working. No other form of test were given so, as of today we can't actually say that the implemented features reported on the IT document were really implemented.
