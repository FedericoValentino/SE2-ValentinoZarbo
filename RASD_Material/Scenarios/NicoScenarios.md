## S2  Educator creates a battle

An educator wants to add another battle in the context of a tournament he is partecipating in. 
He starts by creating a CodeKata assignment (containing description, software project, test cases and build automation scripts) *[w3]* and ultimately creates the battle using the cbk platform.  
On the cbk platform the educator then uploads the code kata assignment and sets: *[wsp1]*
* minimum and maximum number of students per group,
* set a registration deadline,
* set a final submission deadline,
* set additional configurations for optional manual scoring 

Once the battle in is created all the students subscribed to the tournament of said battle receive a notification of its creation.*[msp2]*

## S4 Team of students join a battle

The students are notified of a new battle in the context of a tournament.
A student that decides to join the battle may be asked to join as a group (in case the battle rules ask for it ), and so he invites other students using the ckb platform to create a group that respects the group dimension rule.  
Once every student accepts the new group joins the battle.   

Once the subscription deadline expires the cbk platform creates a github repository containing the codekata and sends every student a link for it.  
At this point for every group the students fork the repository and set up the automated workflow with Github Actions.
At this point the group is ready to start working on the code kata.

## Users look at the battle rank

At any point the students that joined a battle and the educators that are involved with it are able to look at the ranking for said battle.   Every group position is determind by the score given by the platform to their solution of the code kata.
