### SHARED

#### WORLD CONTROLLED

* SP1:	An educator fills out a tournament creation form

* SP2:	An educator uploads the details of a code kata battle(the assignment, the rules, the tests)

* SP3:	A group(maybe singleton) joins a battle respecting the rules regarding the min and max group size

* SP4:	An educator logs into the platform

* SP5: 	A student logs into the platform

* SP6:	The system requires additional manual evalution by an educator for a battle(if required by the rules) 
	#godown

* SP7:	The educator inserts an additional manual score for a battle

* SP8:	A student invites other students to a group to partecipate to a battle

* SP9:	Github on commit notifies the code kata platform

* SP10:	An educator registers an account on the platform

* SP11:	A student registers an account on the platform

* SP12:	A student subscribes to a tournament

* SP13: 	Students and educator look at the rank for a battle they are involved in

* SP14:	Students and educator look at the rank for a tournament

* sp15:	Educator closes tournament

* sp16: 	User looks at list of available tournament

* SP17:	A student accepts and invitet o a group to partecipate to a battle


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### MACHINE CONTROLLED

* SP1:	The platform notifies all students when a tournament is created

* SP2:	The platfotm notifies all students subscribed to a tournament of new upcoming battles

* SP3:	The platform notifies the final score to all students subscribed to a battle, when that battle ends

* SP4:	When the platform is notifies about a commit, it pulls from the committed repository to start the 
	mandatory analysis

* SP5:	The platform creates the github repository for a battle

* SP6:	The platform sends links to the created repository for the battle to all students who are subscribed 
	to the battle

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### MACHINE

* M1:	The platform does the mandatory evaluation at each commit from a student for a battle

* M2:	The platform updates scores and leaderboard of a group

* M3:	The platform updates students personal scores at the end of a battle

* M4: 	Close battle on submission deadline

* s6: 	Team of students join battle [w5,w7,wsp8,w8, msp5, msp6]
* s7:	Application scores commit from student[wsp9, msp4,m1, m2]
* s8:	Users looks at battle rank(only involved) [wsp13]
* s9:	Battle subssion deadline expires [m3, m4,msp3]
* s10: 	Educator close torunament [w10,wsp15, msp14]	
* s11:	Users look at tournament rank[WSP14]

## GoalS

G1: An educator can manage a tournament 

G2:	An educator can create battles inside of a tournament in which he is involved

G3: Students can partecipate in tournaments created by an educator

G4:	Students can partecipate in battles created by an educator, alone or in groups

G5:	Students are scored based on their performance in battles

G6:	The platform allows students and educators to compare the performance of students

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RequirementS

R1:	The platform allows a signed in educator to create tournaments -> G1

R2:	Educators can create battles in the context of a specific tournament they are involved in (Either by creation or by invitation) -> G2

R2.1: The platform allows an educator that created a tournament, to invite other educator and to grant them permission to create battles in the tournament context -> G2

R2.2:	The platform allows an educator to upload the codekata (description and software project, 
including test cases and build automation scripts) when creating a battle -> G2

R2.3: The platform allows an educator to set subscribtion and submission deadlines when creating a battle -> G2

R2.4: The platform allows an educator to set minimum and maximum group size when creating a battle -> G2

R2.5: The platform allows an educator creating a battle to include a manual evaluation stage -> G2

R3:	The platform allows students to subscribe to a tournament -> G3

R4:	The platform allows a student subscribed to a tournament to join a battle in that tournament context-> G4

R4.1: The platform allows students to create a group by inviting other students when joinin a battle -> G4

R5:	The platform allows Students to login -> General Requirement

R6: The platform allows Educators to login -> General Requirement

R7: If manual evaluation is required during consolidation stage the platform allows an educator to go through sources and add a score to the group score -> G5

R8: The platform allows all users to view student ranks from previous and current tournaments -> G6

R8.1: For every tournament the platform maintains a ranking for students based on the sum of their battle scores -> G6

R9: The platform pulls group sources from Github when it receives a notification within the submission deadline -> G5

R9.1: The platform analyzes, runs testcases and scores the source of a group solution for a codekata battle and updates the group score accordingly -> G5

R10: The platform allows all user to sign in -> General Requirement

R11: The platform allows educators to close tournaments -> G1

R12: When a battle deadline expires the platform sets the battle status to consolidation stage -> G5(?)

R13: The platform allows all users who are involved in a battle to look at group ranks for that battle -> G6

R13.1: For every battle the platform maintains a ranking of the groups based on their battle score -> G6

R14: The platform will notify signed students of a newly created tournament -> G3

R15: The platform shall notify students who are subscribed into a tournament that a new battle is available in that tournament context -> G4

R16: The plaftorm shall notify students who are participating in a battle that the final rank for that battle is available -> G6

R17: The plaftorm shall notify students who are subscribed in a tournament that the final rank for that tournament is available -> G6

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ASSUMPTIONS

A1:	The students can correctly setup the Github actions workflow(we dont know how to do it)

A2:	An educator will complete the manual evaluation

A3:	Github will always notifies the CKB platform after every student commit

A4: Students are always able to create a group to join a battle

A5:	Educators will only close a tournament when no battle is still ongoing

A6: Only the Educator who created the tournament will close it
