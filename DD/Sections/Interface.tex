\subsubsection{Login Page}
This page is the first one viewed by the user when accessing the application. It contains two forms, one for the login of the user and one for the registration.
For the login the user can input their Username, password and select whether the user is an Educator or not.

For the registration the user is asked to insert their desired username, the password, and the type of user he desires to register as. Also the user has to insert the email where he will receive notification.

Once the user has created the account or logged into his own account he is directed to the tournaments page.

\subsubsection{Main Page}
In this page a user can see the list of ongoing tournaments and the list of tournaments he/she is involved in, from which a specific tournament can be chosen to be redirected to.
If the user is an Educator then the page will also display a form for the creation of a tournament.

\subsubsection{Tournament Page}
This page contains the list of battle in the context of the current tournament as well as the tournament leaderboard and 3 buttons.
The buttons allow the user to either create a battle in the tournament context, add a collaborator to the tournament or close the tournament.
The battles in the list can be selected to be directed to the selected battle page.
If the user is a student then instead of the three buttons there will be only one, allowing the student to join the tournament.
