	mandatory analysis

SP5:	The platform creates the github repository for a battle

SP6:	The platform sends links to the created repository for the battle to all students who are subscribed 
	to the battle

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

M1:	The platform does the mandatory evaluation at each commit from a student for a battle

M2:	The platform updates scores and leaderboard of a group

M3:	The platform updates students personal scores at the end of a battle

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

G1: 	An educator can create a tournament with a set of rules

G2:	An educator can create battles inside of a tournament, for which he is an organizer or co-organizer

G3:	Students can partecipate and compete in tournaments created by an educator, alone or in groups

G4:	Students are scored based on their performance in battles

G5:	The platform allows students and educators to compare results of the performance of students

A1:	The students can correctly setup the Github actions workflow(we dont know how to do it)

A2:	An educator will complete the manual evaluation

A3:	Github will always notifies the CKB platform after every student commit


#TODO Educator uses the CKB platform to go through all sources for manual evaluation
#TODO Students can look at tournaments rank he is or was subscribed to
#TODO Educators can look at tournaments ranks for students that are or were subscribed to
